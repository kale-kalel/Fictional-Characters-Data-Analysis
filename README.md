# Trait-Distribution-Analysis-Among-Fictional-Human-Characters
## Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning and visualization through analyzing the traits of fictional human characters. The dataset used can be found on Kaggle, [Super Hero Dataset (Comic Super Hero)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aakashverma8900/superhero-api-dataset).

## Project Summary
  1. Certain columns were dropped, and the remaining columns were renamed in a cleaner format.
  2. Nan values in numeric columns were filled in with their respective median.
  3. Numeric values are standardized to follow a specific format (e.g. Height in Feet, Weight in Kilograms).
  4. Nan values in non numeric columns were filled in with either 'Unknown' or 'None'.
